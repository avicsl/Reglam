# Reglam (***Progress: Finishing ui designs***)

**Reglam** is a application designed specifically for beauty enthusiasts who want to responsibly dispose of their empty makeup and skincare containers. This project emphasizes the importance of sustainable practices in the beauty industry by providing users with easy-to-use recycling guidance and gamification elements to encourage environmental responsibility.  


## Project Overview
Rather than focusing solely on beauty consumption, REGLAM highlights sustainabilityâ€”the recycling process that helps reduce beauty industry waste. Utilizing a comprehensive database system as its core, the main objective of this project is to design and implement a well-structured mobile application capable of managing:
- **Recycling Centers**: Locate nearby facilities that accept beauty product containers.
- **User Progress Tracking**: Monitor environmental impact through gamification and achievements.
- **Educational Content**: Provide tips and tutorials for sustainable beauty practices.

## Tools and Technologies Used 

- **Figma**: For UI/UX design and prototyping.  
- **PyQt5**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application.  
- **Qt Designer**: Used to visually design the GUI layout, integrated with PyQt.  
- **MySQL**: Relational database used for storing and managing application data.  
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Code editor used for writing and managing the project source code.
- **Python**: Core programming language for application development.  

## Key Features
- **Progress Tracking**: Statistics and achievements to gamify the recycling process.
- **Brand Database**: Comprehensive information about beauty brands and their sustainability practices.
- **Educational Resources**: Tips for proper container preparation and upcycling ideas.

## Expected Outcomes
This project delivers a comprehensive mobile solution that demonstrates the significance of technology in promoting environmental sustainability within the beauty industry. By focusing on user engagement through gamification and education, REGLAM serves as a valuable tool for beauty enthusiasts to reduce their environmental impact while maintaining their beauty routines. The application showcases modern mobile development practices, database design principles, and the integration of location-based services for real-world problem-solving.
